## Data Analyst | Machine Learning Enthusiast | Strategic Storyteller

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m a Business Insights & Analytics postgraduate from Humber College (Dean’s Honour List) with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable strategies.

## What I Do Best
🔍 Predictive Analytics: Built ML models (e.g., 82.5% accurate loan approval system) to forecast trends and mitigate risks.

📊 Data Visualization: Crafted Power BI/Tableau dashboards that slash reporting time by 40% and drive decisions.

⚡ ETL Automation: Streamlined workflows to boost efficiency and reduce errors across 10+ data sources.

Currently seeking Co-op/Internship/Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) opportunities to solve real-world challenges—from supply chain optimization to financial risk management.
